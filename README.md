## Abstract
In degraded coral reef ecosystems, allelopathic macroalgae have received increasing attention from marine ecologists because their secondary metabolites (also known as allelochemicals) kill corals that grow adjacent to them and weaken the recovery of degraded reefs. One well-known coral-killing macroalga is the calcareous red seaweed *Galaxaura*. However, our knowledge of how coral reef fish interact with allelopathic and unpalatable algae like *Galaxaura* is very limited. Here we document novel observations of feeding interactions of 17 species of coral reef fishes (herbivorous and carnivorous) with the filamentous *Galaxaura divaricata* on degraded lagoon patch reefs in Dongsha Atoll (South China Sea). Video analyses show that territorial farming damselfishes (i.e., *Dischistodus perspicillatus*, *D. prosopotaenia*, *Hemiglyphidodon plagiometopon*, *Pomacentrus grammorhynchus*, *P. adelus* and *Neoglyphidodon nigroris*) and juvenile parrotfishes (*Scarus schlegeli*, *S. ghobban*, *S. rivulatus*, and *Chlorurus spilurus*) likely use *G. divaricata* as a feeding substratum. Further, microscopic analyses revealed that the filamentous surface of *G. divaricata* harbors a wealth of epiphytic microalgae, such as filamentous cyanobacteria (i.e., *Leptolyngbya*, *Lyngbya*, *Rivularia*, *Oscillatoria*, *Stigonema*), diatoms (i.e., *Synedra*, *Nitzschia*, *Mastogloia*, *Pleurosigma*) and filamentous red algae (i.e., *Heterosiphonia*), suggesting that these fishes target the nutrient-rich microscopic epiphytes rather than the nutrient-poor host. Juvenile benthic carnivores (i.e., Labridae, *Parupeneus multifasciatus*, and *Meiacanthus grammistes*) form feeding assemblages with roving parrotfishes to feed on small invertebrates (i.e., amphipods, copepods, isopods, gastropods, polychaetes, and tunicates) associated with *G. divaricata*. Given that coral reef fishes appear to target the epiphytes associated with Galaxaura rather than the alga itself, these observations thus substantiate the threat posed by overgrowth of *G. divaricata* to coral recovery in degraded reef systems due to the lack of natural grazers.
